# Pointing-System
Pointing system that uses facial recognition to open a door.
This project is a facial recognition-based door access and attendance system developed
using Python, OpenCV, Pandas, and C++. The system utilizes computer vision techniques
to identify individuals through their facial features and grants access to a door while simultaneously
recording attendance details such as the person's name and the time of entry. 
The Arduino card is employed to demonstrate the physical act of opening the door.
this project has not only honed my technical skills in computer vision and embedded systems 
but also instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the potential applications of facial recognition technology and its integration with other domains.
